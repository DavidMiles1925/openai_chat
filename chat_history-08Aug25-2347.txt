You: Test

--- Model response ---
Jeeves: Hello — Jeeves here. Test received and working. How can I help you today?

You: Just checking an app I developed to chat with you

--- Model response ---
Jeeves: Looks good — Jeeves here. Want me to run through any specific tests or just a quick checklist to exercise common chat-app features?

If helpful, here are things I can do or you can try quickly:
- Basic messaging (short/long).
- Context carryover (send follow-ups that depend on prior messages).
- Streaming/partial responses (if your app supports it).
- Special content: code blocks, markdown, emojis, non-Latin text.
- File/attachment handling (describe a file or paste sample text).
- Error cases: send an invalid request or large payload.
- Rate-limit/retry behavior (rapid-fire requests).
- Latency and reconnect behavior.

Example test prompts you can send me:
- "Summarize the previous 3 messages in one sentence."
- "Write a 200-word explanation of blockchain in simple terms."
- "Generate

You: Now I am not getting any errors, but it seems my "Forget API Key" is not actually working even after restarting the program. Do I need to clear it from my environment varialbes?

--- Model response ---
Jeeves: Short answer: probably yes — if you set OPENAI_KEY in your environment (shell / system settings) that takes precedence when keyring has no entry. Deleting the key from the OS keychain does not remove any persistent environment variable. Also check that keyring actually deleted the stored secret (and that you used the same SERVICE_NAME / KEYRING_USERNAME).

What to check and how to fix
1) Confirm where the key is coming from
Run this tiny Python snippet (in your app or a small script) to see if the key is in keyring, env, or in-session:

import os
try:
    import keyring
except Exception:
    keyring = None

SERVICE_NAME = "gpt_gui_de"
KEYRING_USERNAME = "openai_api_key"

print("Session key present?:", bool(current_session_key))   # if run from inside app
if keyring:
    try:
        print("Keyring value:", bool(keyring.get_password(SERVICE_NAME, KEYRING_USERNAME)))
    except Exception as e:
        print("Keyring error:", e)
print("Env OPENAI_KEY:", bool(os.getenv("OPENAI_KEY")))
print("Env OPENAI_KEY (raw):", os.getenv("OPENAI_KEY"))

If keyring.get_password returns a value (True), the key is stored in the OS keychain. If os.getenv("OPENAI_KEY") is non-empty, the env var is present and will be used if keyring is empty.

2) Remove stored keyring entry (if present)
- From Python (works cross-platform if keyring backend available):
import keyring
keyring.delete_password("gpt_gui_de", "openai_api_key")

- Or via OS UI:
  - Windows: Credential Manager → Windows Credentials → look for an entry named like your SERVICE_NAME.
  - macOS: Keychain Access → search for SERVICE_NAME.
  - Linux: Seahorse (Passwords and Keys) or the credential manager your distro uses.

3) Remove any persistent OPENAI_KEY environment variable
If the env var is set persistently, deleting keyring won't help — you must remove that env var. How depends on OS:

- Windows (PowerShell — removes user-level variable):
  [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("OPENAI_KEY", $null, "User")
  Then sign out/sign back in (or restart) for system changes to take effect. To remove for the current PowerShell session:
  $env:OPENAI_KEY = $null

- macOS / Linux (shell profiles):
  - Edit your shell profile (~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, ~/.zshrc, etc.) and remove the line that sets OPENAI_KEY export OPENAI_KEY="..."
  - Then either source the file or restart the terminal/session: source ~/.bashrc

4) Make Forget fully clear the session in your app
Your current forget_api_key deletes the keyring entry but may leave a session key in memory. Use this improved function so the app also clears the session key and updates the UI immediately:

def forget_api_key():
    delete_api_key_from_keyring()
    # clear the in-memory session key and re-init client so SDK falls back to env var (if any)
    global current_session_key
    current_session_key = None
    init_client_with_key(None)
    chat_history.configure(state='normal')
    chat_history.insert(tk.END, "API key removed from system keychain and cleared from this session. If OPENAI_KEY is set as an environment variable, it will still be used until you remove it.\n\n")
    chat_history.configure(state='disabled')
    chat_history.see(tk.END)
    update_api_widgets()

(You already call init_client_with_key(None) — the key piece is clearing current_session_key so update_api_widgets sees there is no session key.)

5) Optionally add a small "Where is my key from?" helper in the UI
A small helper is handy to show the actual source:

def show_key_status():
    kr = None
    if keyring:
        try:
            kr = keyring.get_password(SERVICE_NAME, KEYRING_USERNAME)
        except Exception:
            kr = None
    env = os.getenv("OPENAI_KEY")
    chat_history.configure(state='normal')
    chat_history.insert(tk.END, f"Key status — session: {'set' if current_session_key else 'none'}, keyring: {'set' if kr else 'none'}, env: {'set' if env else 'none'}\n\n")
    chat_history.configure(state='disabled')
    chat_history.see(tk.END)

You can wire that to a menu item (Key → Show Key Status) for quick debugging.

Summary
- Deleting the keyring entry alone won't remove an OPENAI_KEY environment variable; you must remove that separately.
- Confirm with the Python checks above whether the key is in keyring or env.
- Update forget_api_key to clear current_session_key and re-init client (example above).
- If you want, I can:
  - Provide the small patch to your script that clears current_session_key and adds a "Show Key Status" menu item, or
  - Give step-by-step commands specific to your OS for removing the env var. Which would you prefer?
